> **Practical Excel tools to accelerate your startup's growth** 🚀

A collection of optimized and ready-to-use Excel spreadsheets, specifically developed to meet the analysis and management needs of growing startups.

## 🎯 About the Project

**ExcelTools for Startups** was born from the need for practical and realistic growth analysis tools. Tired of seeing forecasts that only work in Excel and die in the real world, I developed implementations of mathematical models that reflect the true dynamics of companies.

The spreadsheets are available for non-commercial use. The mathematical models are scientific concepts that anyone can study and implement independently.

### Why these tools?
- ✅ **Tested mathematical models**: Practical implementations of scientific concepts
- ✅ **Ready to use**: Familiar Excel interface, no programming required
- ✅ **Educational**: Learn the concepts behind growth models
- ✅ **Support available**: Consulting for personalized commercial implementations

### 📈 Mathematical Model for Firm Growth
**File**: `Customer Growth.xlsx`

An innovative mathematical model that divides customer growth into **THREE REALISTIC STAGES**, developed by Vinícius Garcia Canonici:

**🎯 The 3 Growth Phases:**

1️⃣ **Linear Phase (Bootstrap)**: Hand-to-hand growth, customer by customer
   - Formula: `f(t) = α * k₁ * t`

2️⃣ **Exponential Phase (Explosion)**: Growth accelerates, word-of-mouth booms  
   - Formula: `f(t) = f(t₁) + α * A * (e^{k₂·(t-t₁)} - 1)`

3️⃣ **Logarithmic Phase (Saturation)**: Market limits appear
   - Formula: `f(t) = f(t₂) + α * B * ln(k₃ · (t-t₂) + 1)`

**📊 Essential Parameters:**
- Linear (k₁), exponential (k₂) and logarithmic (k₃) rates
- Jump amplitude (A) and Market ceiling (B)
- Impulse (α) and Turning times (t₁, t₂, t₃)

#### How to use:
1. Download the `Customer Growth.xlsx` file
2. Enter your company's historical data
3. Configure the mathematical model parameters
4. Analyze the 3 growth phases and identify which phase your company is in
5. Use projections to make strategic decisions about scaling, innovating or pivoting

**💡 The differential:** This isn't just "pretty numbers" - the model shows the right moment for each strategic decision and prepares you for when exponential growth inevitably comes to an end.
